This repo contains the data viz and analysis of a unique 9.5 m palaeo-lacustrine record of 771 palaeofloods which 
occurred over a period of 9.3 kyr in the Piànico–Sèllere Basin (southern Alps) during an interglacial period in the Pleistocene (sometime from 780 to 393 ka).
These flood events are considered as an event series, i.e. the timings of the flooding events are investigated but not on their magnitudes/ intensities. 
Similar analyses can ce performed for other event series. Then some parameters (in particular, the considered time interval length as parameters of filtering procedures) need to be adapted.

A more comprehensive model-driven analysis of this palaeoflood data set can be found in our paper:
