This repo contains the data viz and analysis of a unique 9.5 m palaeo-lacustrine record of 771 palaeofloods which 
occurred over a period of 9.3 kyr in the Piànico–Sèllere Basin (southern Alps) during an interglacial period in the Pleistocene (sometime from 780 to 393 ka).

A more comprehensive analysis can be found in our paper:
